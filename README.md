#Marenostrum Sounds

A collection of electronic sounds of [Marenostum, the Spanish supercomputer](http://www.bsc.es/marenostrum-support-services/mn3).

These sounds were recorded in the summer of 2013 by [Ben Lukas Boysen](http://benlukasboysen.com/), also known as HECQ, and used in part to make the music and sound effects of the mini-documentary Supercomputers. HECQ went on to compose a [full album](http://benlukasboysen.com/albums/mare-nostrum/) using only these sounds. 

This collection is part of the [Algorritmo](http://www.bsc.es/viz/algorritmo) project, where an algorithm running in Marenostrum will compose music guided by the audience of the [Sonar+D 2016 festival](http://sonarplusd.com/). In particular, the MIDI songs created by Algorritmo will be synthesized using instruments created with these sounds, as if Marenostrum was playing music using its own body. The project is created by the [Scientific Visualization Team](http://www.bsc.es/viz/) at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](http://www.bsc.es/).
