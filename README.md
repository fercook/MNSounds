A collection of electronic sounds of Marenostum, the Spanish supercomputer.

These sounds were recorded in the summer of 2013 by Benjamin Boysen, also known as HECQ, and used in part to make the music and sound effects of the mini-documentary Supercomputers. HECQ went on to compose a full album using only these sounds. 

This collection is part of the Algorritmo project, where an algorithm running in Marenostrum will compose music guided by the audience of the Sonar 2016 festival. In particular, the MIDI songs created by Algorritmo will be synthesized using instruments created with these sounds, as if Marenostrum was playing music using its own body.
